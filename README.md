# 🌌 StarNova — Exoplanet Discovery Project  

Welcome to the official repository of **Team StarNova**!  
This project combines **astronomy, data science, and machine learning** to identify and classify exoplanets from NASA datasets.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  

The **StarNova Website** is an interactive platform that showcases our work in cleaning, merging, and analyzing exoplanet datasets.  
We developed a **LightGBM machine learning model** to predict whether a candidate planet is **Confirmed** or **False Positive**.

## 💡 Key Features  

- 🧹 **Automated Data Cleaning:** Handles missing values and normalizes classification labels.  
- 🔗 **Unified Dataset:** Combines data from Kepler, K2, and TOI missions into a single clean file.  
- 🤖 **ML Model (LightGBM):** Trains and predicts classifications for new candidate planets.  
- 🧭 **Interactive Tool:** Lets users search planets and view prediction results easily.  
- 🌌 **Modern Design:** Clean, futuristic interface that matches the theme of space exploration.

## 🧩 How It Works  

1. **Preprocessing:** Clean each dataset and unify classification labels.  
2. **Merging:** Combine all sources into a single file (`master_cleaned.csv`).  
3. **Model Training:** Train LightGBM on cleaned data for binary classification.  
4. **Prediction:** Generate predictions for candidate planets.  
5. **Web Interface:** Display results interactively through our custom site.

## 🔮 Future Work  

- 🌠 Enhance prediction accuracy using deep learning.  
- 🌌 Integrate visualization dashboards (e.g., Plotly, D3.js).  
- 🪐 Build an API for public access to planet predictions.  
- 🚀 Expand to new NASA missions and datasets.
